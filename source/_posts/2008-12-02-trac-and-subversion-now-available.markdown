I am still in the midst of getting everything made available.

<a href=" https://svn.saiweb.co.uk">
https://svn.saiweb.co.uk</a>

<a href="https://trac.saiweb.co.uk">https://trac.saiweb.co.uk</a>

From now all all development will be checked into the saiweb subversion, the existing sourceforge and wordpress repositories will only be used to push releases to.

If you should find a bug and/or have a feature request please register with the trac system and start creating tickets.

Cheers


Buzz

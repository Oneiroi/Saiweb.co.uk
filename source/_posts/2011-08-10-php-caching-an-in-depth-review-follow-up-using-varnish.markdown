Ok, so following up on PHP & Caching with Varnish, let's cut to the hard facts shall we?

2716.92 requests per second with a server load average of 0.1, and in this case varnish is serving cache from disk.

Caching using varnish (Or even nginx / mod_cache) means that PHP does not get executed at all, the cache system grabs the cache content and serves it.

This of course has the benefit of reducing the CPU and memory resources needed for the running of your application, but it does have some caveats.

<ul>
	<li>This only works for GET requests, and content not reliant on Cookies (Truely dynamic content will not cache)</li>
	<li>But on the "flipside" Varnish supports ESI, which when setup correctly you can target the dynamic sections of a pag for "passthrough" and have the rest cached</li>
<ol>


More details to come, as I have time to add them I have have a lot of posts to make on boxgrinder, KVM, libvirtd etc.

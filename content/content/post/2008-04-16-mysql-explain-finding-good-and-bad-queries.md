<p>Trent Hornibrook has started a mysql dba blog, so I thought i'd provide some linkage :-)</p>
<p>These two articles cover how to use the mysql explain syntax for "debugging" sql queries so be sure to read <a href="https://mysqldbahelp.com/2008/04/13/using-explain-to-find-good-and-bad-queries/" target="_blank">part 1</a> and <a href="https://mysqldbahelp.com/2008/04/13/using-explain-to-find-good-and-bad-queries-part-2/">part 2</a></p>

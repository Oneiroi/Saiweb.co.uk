title: CVE-2015-1027 percona-toolkit and percona-xtrabackup
---

Since my move to information security architect at Percona back in November of 2014 I've been able to begin to curate and build a responsible disclosure program for which I hope best reflects that of a responsible open source vendor. 

There is still penty to do here of course, and more is yet to come on this front.

The first public success story may be considered a minor one but I feel it is an important step toward responsible disclosure.

The blog post disclosure on percona.com [may be found here](https://www.percona.com/blog/2015/05/06/percona-security-advisory-cve-2015-1027/) and I'm hosting a plaintext version [here](https://blog.oneiroi.co.uk/disclosures/CVE-2015-1027.txt)

The initial research began 2014-12-16 at this time a functional PoC was created and distributed internally to allow the developers to test their fix this means from concept to fix (2015-01-16) took one calendar month, with percona-toolkit 2.2.13 being released 2015-01-26 and percona-xtrabackup 2.2.9 being released 2015-02-17.

So why you may as did the disclsure not occur untill 2015-05-06 ? simply put to allow user and distros to update; and frankly this was by far the hardest part trying to illict response from distros began to seem to a fruitless task.

And thus I had planned to just go ahead with the disclosure 2015-04-30, it was around this time we were contacted by the people over at [oCERT](https://ocert.org) regarding and entirely seperate issue [CVE-2015-3152](https://www.ocert.org/advisories/ocert-2015-003.html) for which you can read more about how this is looking to be addressed on [Todd Farmer's blog](https://mysqlblog.fivefarmers.com/2015/04/29/ssltls-in-5-6-and-5-5-ocert-advisory/).

Following the interaction with oCERT (namely Andrea B), we've since applied for membership with oCERT and work continues on curating a responsible disclosure plan.

If you have any suggestions / comments on the progression of the responsible disclosure program I'd be glad to hear them via email to:

```
david {dot} busby {at} percona {dot} com
```

You can use either my gpg  pubkey at [keybase.io](https://keybase.io/oneiroi) or [0x5422aa2ab636da5a](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x5422AA2AB636DA5A) 

Please remember the program is still very much in its early stages as such time to disclosure are typically longer than exepect (as can be seen from CVE-2015-1027).

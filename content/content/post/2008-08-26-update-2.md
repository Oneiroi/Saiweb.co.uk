Ok now it has all been officialy announced here at work I can finaly update this blog.

I have been offered a new job with <a href="https://www.psycle.com/en/">Psycle Interactive</a>, as such I have given notice with my current employers <a href="https://www.visiumgroup.com/">Visium Group</a>.

Now I can update you with the current situation, I know many of you are still waiting for the next part of the "Build Your Own HD Youtube" tutorial, but as you can appreciate I have been a little busy with documentation pending my departure of Visium Group.

So for the next couple of weeks at least updates to this blog will be sporadic.

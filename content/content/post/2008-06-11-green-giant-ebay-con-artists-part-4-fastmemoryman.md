Name and shame time!

Remember this blog <a href="https://blog.oneiroi.co.uk/green-giant/green-giant-ebay-con-artists-part-3">here</a>?

Well it seems our "friend" at ebay has had 458 negative feedback this month alone, infact just google <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=fastmemoryman">fastmemoryman</a>.

Ebay's reply came back as they can basically do nothing ... beware this seller and avoid at all costs.

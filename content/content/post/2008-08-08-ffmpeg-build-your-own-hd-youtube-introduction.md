The thing that has realy annoyed me lately is the lack of documentation to be found for FFMPEG, the documentation you can find is by way of MAN pages, and makes the assumption you allready know all the terms that go with video encoding.

Well I am to change that.

Over the next few days I will be producing a Video set "Build your own HD YouTube" covering installation of FFMPEG, to building a basic PHP front end (without using PHP-FFMPEG), and finaly a summary covering methods you should use if you want to use the methods covered in a production envrionment.

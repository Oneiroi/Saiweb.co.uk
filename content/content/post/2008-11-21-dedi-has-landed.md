The dedi server is online, as such blog.oneiroi.co.uk will be migrating over this weekend :)

I am currently getting subversion and trac setup taking svnsync copies of adimpleo, wordpress-flowplayer and acies :-)

phpbuzz.co.uk should make it live this weekend also, once I have some content hand ins from people contributing articles.

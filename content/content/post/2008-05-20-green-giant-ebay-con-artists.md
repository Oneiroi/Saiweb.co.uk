<div style=''>So I got my "adjusted" postage ... the seller has increased the
combined postage to £64 and then applied a £48 discount, yeh you
guessed it resulting in the same £16 (£4 per card) postage cost ...<br /><br />I've
seen some blatant attempts to con people before, but just ... wow ...
I'm giving the selling on ebay time to correct this ... otherwise I'm
going to name and shame.<br /></div>

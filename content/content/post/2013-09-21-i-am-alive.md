title: I am alive, the last 8 months in review
---

Well, where to begin.

2013 has been a year of change for myself, after a long consideration period spanning several months in 2012 I felt that it was time to move on from [Psycle Interactive](https://psycle.com) as their Systems Administrator; the new roles "on the table" were as follows:

* Percona   - Systems Admin role which later became a Remote DBA role
* Rackspace - Systems Admin
* Google    - Systems engineer
* Facebook  - Systems engineer

I accepted the  offer from Percona becoming part of the [Remote DBA](https://www.percona.com/products/mysql-remote-dba)  [team](https://www.percona.com/about-us/our-team); the growth over the last 8 months has in my opinion been very rapid; the team and client list has more than doubled in size.

So some highlights on what I have been up to this year (well what I can talk about at least).

* [Adventures in archiving](https://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2013/02/11/adventures-in-archiving/) - A case review exploring the use of the MySQL archive engine vs other available compression formats.
* [Percona Live 2013 Committee member](https://www.percona.com/live/london-2013/conference-committee)
* Submitted talks to OSCON - unfortunately they did not make the schedule this year.
* [Security talk at Percona Live 2013](https://www.percona.com/live/london-2013/sessions/security-and-why-you-need-review-yours) - just to be clear committee members can not review their own submissions; thus this talk was reviewed as any other submission (minus one casting vote).
* [Work on flashcache RPMs for el6, Fedora](https://github.com/percona/flashcache)
* [Wrote replacement cluster check service in python](https://github.com/Oneiroi/clustercheck) - this is now included in [Percona XtraDB Cluster](https://www.percona.com/software/percona-xtradb-cluster).
* [Technical reviewer for Scratch Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/scratch-programs-cookbook/book)

There's so much more which I can not talk about with it being IP / NDA related.

Expect more security focused posts soon as I work on their content.
